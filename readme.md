#Factorio Mod Maker
or FMM for short

Requirements:
port 8080 aviable
nodejs for your OS
git

#Development setup:
git clone
> npm install --dev

> sudo npm test

Needs admin permissions to overwrite old versions of mods, great for
testing but bad in production.

Most changes should be in nodeServer.js and /static/
*Do not* increment the version number in package.json when submitting pull requests.

#Installation
git clone
> npm install

> npm start
